# Um Jammer Lammy Raw Addresses Cheat Engine Table
Raw addresses found in Um Jammer Lammy NTSC-U. Basically the same as the Bizhawk branch, only much more compatible with emulators with fluctuating addresses such as DuckStation or general emulators like ePSXe.
Includes things like score gains, timed inputs, internal rapping values, and AI line editing. <p>
I don't know when it's considered "completely finished", but my goal is to include every line address for both Rammy and PaRappa. <p>
No knowledge of coding is necessary; just download or clone this project and load the cheat table with Cheat Engine. Cloning is highly recommended as you'll get the latest additions as soon as they come.<p>
