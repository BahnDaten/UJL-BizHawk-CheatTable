# Um Jammer Lammy BizHawk Cheat Engine Table
A Cheat Engine table for Um Jammer Lammy, NTSC-U, for Bizhawk.
Includes things like score gains, timed inputs, internal rapping values, and AI line editing. <p>
I don't know when it's considered "completely finished", but my goal is to include every line address for both Rammy and PaRappa. <p>
No knowledge of coding is necessary; just download or clone this project and load the cheat table with Cheat Engine. Cloning is highly recommended as you'll get the latest additions as soon as they come.<p>
A version for ePSXe is planned but not the main focus. If you want a cheat table for ePSXe, recalculate the addresses yourself or download another table, which includes both NTSC and PAL and PTR1, made by another PaRappa modder <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411556586905927710/413141119283757057/ePSXe.CT" target="_blank">here</a>.
