# Um Jammer Lammy BizHawk Cheat Engine Table
A Cheat Engine table for Um Jammer Lammy, NTSC-U, for Bizhawk.
Includes things like score gains, timed inputs, internal rapping values, and AI line editing. <br>
I don't know when it's time to call it "completely finished", but my goal is to include every line address for both Rammy and Parappa. <p>
Porting it to ePSXe is planned but not the main focus. If you want a cheat table for ePSXe, recalculate the addresses yourself or download another table, which includes both NTSC and PAL and PTR1, made by another PaRappa modder <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411556586905927710/413141119283757057/ePSXe.CT" target="_blank">here</a>.
