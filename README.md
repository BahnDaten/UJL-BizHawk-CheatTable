# Um Jammer Lammy Raw Addresses Cheat Engine Table
Raw addresses found in Um Jammer Lammy NTSC-U. Pretty much compatible with 32-bit emulators such as ePSXe, Mednafen, or the 32-bit version of Retroarch.
Includes things like score gains, timed inputs, internal rapping values, and CPU line editing (though it's largely incomplete and most of the addresses in Co-op need fixing). <p>
**This cheat table will not work unless you offset _all_ addresses by your PSX emulator's memory map. Emulators with non-static addresses (e.g. DuckStation and other 64-bit emulators) are much trickier to set up.** <p>
No knowledge of coding is necessary; just download or clone this project and load the cheat table with Cheat Engine. Cloning is highly recommended as you'll get the latest additions as soon as they come.<p>
