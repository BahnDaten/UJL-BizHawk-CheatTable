# Um Jammer Lammy Raw Addresses Cheat Engine Table
Raw addresses found in Um Jammer Lammy NTSC-U. Pretty much compatible with emulators with fluctuating addresses such as DuckStation or general emulators like ePSXe and Mednafen.
Includes things like score gains, timed inputs, internal rapping values, and AI line editing (though it's largely incomplete and most of the addresses in Co-op need fixing). <p>
**This cheat table will not do anything unless you offset _all_ addresses by your PSX emulator's memory map.** <p>
No knowledge of coding is necessary; just download or clone this project and load the cheat table with Cheat Engine. Cloning is highly recommended as you'll get the latest additions as soon as they come.<p>
